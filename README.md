# some mini project description

1. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their marks. 

Based on the marks, the program should print the grade according to the following criteria:
Marks >= 90: Grade A
Marks >= 80 and < 90: Grade B
Marks >= 70 and < 80: Grade C
Marks >= 60 and < 70: Grade D
Marks < 60: Grade F

2. Write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest and smallest of the three using conditional statements.

3. Write a Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

4. Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and checks if the number is even or odd.

5. Write a program that takes a character input from the user and checks if it is a vowel or a consonant.

6. Write a Python program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. If the operator is not recognized, print an error message.

7. Write a program that takes the user's age as input and prints out the age category:
Age < 13: Child
Age >= 13 and < 20: Teenager
Age >= 20 and < 60: Adult
Age >= 60: Senior Citizen

8. Write a Python program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

9. Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa based on user input. Use conditional statements to determine which conversion to perform.

10. Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks if it is divisible by 5, 7, or both. Print the appropriate message based on the divisibility.
